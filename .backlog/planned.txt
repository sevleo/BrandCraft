Bugs/enhancements:
- add video size & length validation (60s max for bluesky)
- change all file routes to media.brandcraft.art
- Links and hashtags on mastodon/bluesky are not clickable.
- Implement YT thumbnail
- no need to make the user wait until video converts. just add a checkbox in post indicating that conversion is still in process and do not schedule it while it is in process.
- when user has 2 accounts (e.g. google and github) tied with same email, and if they set password for one or both of them, it will be a problem.
- wrap Threads calls inside a token refresher in scheduler
- wrap Tiktok calls inside a token refresher in scheduler
- implement refresh based on refreshToken expiryTimestamp. If current time is less than 10 minutes away from expiryTimestamp, refresh tokens
- make it possible to schedule only 3 months upfront
- make sure to automatically delete media from S3 after 3 months + 1 day
- After relogin it shows that posts are made from this account instead of the previous.
- do not allow to edit a post from the calendar which is already published
- Add previews to other platforms
- on list view, list the platforms of a message in a predefiened order (now twitter can be 1 or 2 or 3 depending on i dont know what)
- when all posts are failed in a bundle, it still shows as "partially published"
- when refreshing threads in scheduler-service, update user profile picture too




Techn debt:
- Refactor media upload code and storage file to make it cleaner
- Refactor groupStatus, make it so it works independently and sets the group status based on the status of all individual posts.
    make sure it doesn't break how posts work. they shouldnt depend on status of parent group anyway.
- Refactor error management flow in threadsController (standardize error handling for all platforms)
- check if there is any further refactoring needed for video adjustments for posting to TikTok/IG/YT etc
- update PlatformButton to use FontAwesomeIcon for all other platforms (right now only IG)
- implement message queue for scheduler
- strip dockerfiles of unnecessary steps
- when user does something in the app (tbd what exactly), request updates information about accounts (e.g. new avatar)
- update account session management to work with multiple servers
- move scheduler to a worker process
- refactor Creation view so that all posts are created in backend with "temp" status, which will then be replaced with "scheduled" or "draft" status, and if user does not proceed with them, they will be deleted automatically after a while. temp will not show in Publish view, it will only show in the Create view
- remove "Any" types  everywhere
- when user logins, refresh access tokens based on refresh token for all accounts
- we need to change how group status works and when files are deleted from S3. We need to keep track of individual post retries, and when all posts
    in a group have finished retrying, then we "lock" the group and deletes files from S3
- refactor all circle buttons and icons (userProfile + platform) to reusable components







- Show post upload status
    - maybe use websockets to stream it live from the server
    - show status per platform
    - show errors per platform
    - allow retry post for platform if error
    - if all errors, allow retry post for all platforms
